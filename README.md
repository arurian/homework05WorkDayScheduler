Work Day Scheduler
------------------

This app loops through the hours of 9am - 5pm for a specific date, today. The app allows the user to enter and save text into any description field. The data will be saved to the localStorage of the browser. The past hours are highlighted gray, the current hour red, and future hours green.
Using a foreach loop, the visual for the work day scheduler is being created dynamically.
The date information is retrieved using moment.js.
